# Project
# we are interested in U.S. honey bee productions
# https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en
# Our data source is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economics, Statistics and Market Information System honey publication. The files contain the annual report of the number of colonies producing honey, yield per colony, honey production, average price, price by color class and value; honey stocks by state and U.S.
# The data types presented by this data source are string, integer, and floating point. 
# The only restriction found with this data type is when colonies produce honey in more than one state as bees are not restricted to state lines. The sourse solved this my counting those colonies in each state. 
# This data sourse is easily accessable and shows up when researching honey bee production in the U.S. in a search engine. A pro to this data source is that each years' data accessable in PDF, TXT, and ZIP format with clear explanations of the data in each file.
