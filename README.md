# Project
# We researched U.S. honey bee productions, more specifically how the number of honey producing colonines, production of those colonies, and value of that production changed over the course of the past five years.  
# Data Source
# Link to our data source: https://usda.library.cornell.edu/concern/publications/hd76s004z?locale=en
# Our data source is the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Economics, Statistics and Market Information System honey publication. The files contain the annual reports (by each state and the overall U.S.) of the number of colonies producing honey, yield per colony, honey production, honey stocks, average price per pound of honey, value of production, and price by color.
# The data types presented by this data source is string, integer, and floating point in a table format.
# The restrictions found with this data type is since the tables are looking at statistics for each U.S. state, when colonies produce honey in more than one state as bees are not restricted to state lines, the sourse counted those colonies as apart of each state. 
# One of the biggest pros of this data sourse, is that it is easily accessable and shows up when researching honey bee production in the U.S. Another pro is that each years' data is given in a variety of formats including PDF, TXT, and ZIP format with CSV. Within each file this source gives clear explanations of the data, how certain issues with the data were resolved, and small write-ups of the statistics shown. 
# Data Pulling
# For the data pulling, we downloaded the latest five available data publications (the years 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022, and 2023) as ZIP files. Each years' ZIP file contained CSV files for all individual tables avaible. We uploaded only the tables containing the data points we were using into our GitHub repository. 
# Data Cleaning
# We chose to not use the tables on "Honey Price by Color Class," "Income and Expenditures," "Queen, Package, and Nuc Prices Paid," "Apiary Workers," or "Reliability of Honey Estimates."
